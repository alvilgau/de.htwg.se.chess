# Chess

This project is an implementation of the Chess game for the lecture Software Engineering of the University of Applied Science Konstanz, Germany.

It was important to have a good Model-View-Controller-structure and to implement some patterns like the Observer-Pattern
(which is necessary for running the TUI and the GUI at the same time).

Furthermore we should use dependency injection with Google Guice.

Further requirements of this project were:

* using the version control with git on github.
* performing test-driven-development using JUnit.
* metrics with sonar.
* components and interfaces between each layer.
